	Paths used in hashing must be normalized.

	All paths must be "cleaned", must begin in `./`, and directory names must be slash-suffixed.
	This is identical in behavior to `filepath.Clean` having been called on each path,
	with the exception of the prefix and suffixed directories.

	These behaviors results in outputs that naturally sort into a tree ordering:
	slash-suffixed dirnames under a simple string sort become ordered such that
	parent dirs come before their children, and **immediately** before their children,
	which dramatically simplifies processing -- in-order traversals as both a list
	and as a tree are possible as O(n) operations, and do not require the entire
	dataset to be seekable in memory.

	`metadata.Name` must be normalized before recording into the bucket --
	see the `Normalize` function.  Use of the `Normalize` function specifically is not
	required, but data outside of the normalized format may result in panics.

	Currently this just has an in-memory implementation, but something backed by
	e.g. boltdb for really large file trees would also make sense.
